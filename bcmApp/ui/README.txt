The user interface files are stored seperatly:
$PYDM/gadc/bcm for updated versions of BCM screens
$PYDM/gadc/general for screens shared between BCM, BLEN and BPM 
$PYDM/evnt for the trigger screens

Please make a best effort to keep the changes to $PYDM/gadc/bcm saved here.
However $PYDM/gadc/bcm is considered the master repository of the BCM UI
