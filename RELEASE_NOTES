          - For IOCs connecting to boards with a single AMC card, bay 0 must be
            used. Otherwise the firmawre does not work properly. For the IOCs

            of the integration window in a user friendly way. It is now a Python

            sioc-gunb-fc01 and sioc-gunb-im01 run on cpu-gunb-sp01 which is not yet ready to
            move to buildroot2019 and epics 7.0.3 (3.6 release series). This release is a stopgap to
            fix the PV name conflict until the IOCs can be updated to R3.6.x

R3.5.1    Marcio Donadio (marcio) - 10/21/2019
            - Removed the temporary disabling of bsaDriver on boot.
            - Upgraded a bunch of modules to fix crashes that were happening in

            - Included adittional parameter to LCLS-II toroid BSA: 
              charge minus TMIT.
            - Raised precision of the fields on bcmFcCoef.edl.

R3.3.2    Marcio Donadio (marcio) - 8/16/2019
            - Updated Keithley and L2MPS modules.

R3.3.1    Marcio Donadio (marcio) - 8/13/2019
            - Updated modules with fix to MPS.

R3.3.0    Marcio Donadio (marcio) - 8/13/2019
            - Deleted getBergozLocation.sh from iocBoot/sioc-gunb-im01.
            - Added script to configure Bergoz device 44.
            - Fixed path for getBergozLocation.sh in st.cmd.

R3.2.0    Marcio Donadio (marcio) - 8/13/2019
            - Transferred getBergozLocation.sh from the iocBoot/sioc*
              directories to bcmApp/scripts in order to avoid copying and
              maitaining the same script to all Toroid IOCs.
            - When the script configured the serial port, Bergoz parameters got
              corrupted. Leonid explained that all the features of this script 
              were used when we had one CPU taking care of many Bergoz. This use
              case is not needed anymore and, so, the script could be 
              simplified. The misconfiguration issue was fixed with the
              simplified script.
            - getBergozLocation.sh now saves the file in /tmp instead of /data.
            - getBergozConfig.sh and setBergozConfig_dev*.sh are now part of
              the IOC app.

R3.1.0          Marcio Donadio (marcio)                         -7/31/2019
                      - Using new version of the Bergoz and Stream Device
                        modules.
                      - Separated serial traffic of outgoing messages from
                        incoming messages for Bergoz, as the amount of messages
                        was preventing the IOC to write to the device. Due to
                        an yet non-identified problem, booting the IOC with
                        Bergoz sending unsolicited messages makes the CPU go to
                        100% load. Provisionally, the st.cmd is turning off the
                        trigger to stop Bergoz messages and turning them back
                        on after 1 second.
                      - Removed ethercat.pyc file, as it is generated during
                        the build process.
                      - Updated yaml files. In the future they should be read
                        from the FPGA PROM.
                      - Improvements in st.cmd.

R3.0.4		Marcio Donadio (marcio) 			-7/22/2019

                                - saveLoadConfig.db now takes only P and PORT
                                  as macros. All other parameters - file names
                                  and yaml root - were transferred to dbpf. In
                                  the future this should go to autosave.
