This EPICS IOC Application is responsible for controlling the Bunch Charge 
Monitor and its related components. It can be used with Toroid or Faraday Cup 
types.

This IOC will also interface to a temperature chassis which monitors 
temperature for bunch charge devices. In addidtion, this IOC application will
monitor temperature devices associated with BunchLength hardware and sensors.

The controls interfaces to this system are:
EtherCAT --> Temperature Chassis
Ethernet/RSSI --> ATCA BCM Carrier
USB --> Bergoz
RS232 --> Keithley

1. Before using this application, for all IOCs inside iocBoot directory, set correct values for parameters that are available in st.cmd files:
- K6482_ADDRESS: Keithley address in digi.
- IP of the ATCA board, that is a parameter of the function YCPSWASYNConfig.
- BERGOZ_TTY: serial port of the Bergoz equipment.
- Optional: uncomment functions asynSetTraceIOMask and asynSetTraceMask for diagnostic messages when communicating to equipment.

2. In the TOP directory, run make and wait until it finishes.

3. Go to each ioc directory related to this application inside $IOC directory and change the symbolic link iocSpecificRelease to point to the correct installation location.
